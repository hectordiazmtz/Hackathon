### Prerequisites

The minimum prerequisites to run this sample are:
* The latest update of Visual Studio 2015. You can download the community version [here](http://www.visualstudio.com) for free.
* The Bot Framework Emulator. To install the Bot Framework Emulator, download it from [here](https://emulator.botframework.com/). Please refer to [this documentation article](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator/wiki/Getting-Started) to know more about the Bot Framework Emulator.


#### LUIS Application
The first step to using LUIS is to create or import an application. Go to the home page, www.luis.ai, and log in. After creating your LUIS account you'll be able to Import an Existing Application where can you can select a local copy of the LuisBot.json file an import it.

Once you imported the application you'll need to "train" the model ([Training](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/LUIS-api/documentation/Train-Test)) before you can "Publish" the model in an HTTP endpoint. For more information, take a look at [Publishing a Model](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/LUIS-api/documentation/PublishApp).

Finally, edit the [RootLuisDialog.cs](Dialogs/RootLuisDialog.cs#L14) file and update the LuisModel attribute placeholders with the values corresponding to your Subscription and Application.


````C#
    ...
    using Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Luis.Models;
    using Microsoft.Bot.Connector;

    [LuisModel("YourModelId", "YourSubscriptionKey")]
    public class RootLuisDialog : LuisDialog<object>
    {
    ...
````

#### Where to find the Application ID and Subscription Key

You'll need these two values to configure the LuisDialog through the LuisModel attribute:

1. Application ID

    In the LUIS application's dashboard, you can copy the App ID from the address bar.
    
    ![App Settings](images/prereqs-appid.png)
    
2. Subscription Key

    In the [My keys page](https://www.luis.ai/home/keys), copy the Programmatic API Key.

> **Limitations**  
> The functionality provided by the Bot Framework Activity can be used across many channels. Moreover, some special channel features can be unleashed using the [ChannelData property](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-channeldata).
> 
> The Bot Framework does its best to support the reuse of your Bot in as many channels as you want. However, due to the very nature of some of these channels, some features are not fully portable.
> 
> The features used in this sample are fully supported in the following channels:
> - Cortana
> 
> They are also supported, with some limitations, in the following channels:
> - Email
